# ai_framework
This is a speech recognition artificial intelligence framework that is aimed at being self programable (to the fullest extent), self learning, and fluid enough to where everything you want it to do, you can get it to do just by simply talking/typing to it.

#installation / basic usage
1. in a directory of your choosing, run command "git clone https://github.com/the-py-guy/ai_framework"
2. cd into ai_framework
3. run command "python main.py"

#advanced usage
since this is AI, your words do not need to be exact for any of the following commands we are about to go over. just say something similar and the AI will most likely know what you mean if it doesn't, it will let you know it doesnt understand (try again but rephrase your sentence). with that being said, lets go into the advanced usage.

just to reiterate, all you need to do is say something similar to the following sentences.

saying "add a new action" will cause the AI to ask you what phrase should trigger this new action, lets respond: "tell me the weather" the AI has now remembered the phrase "tell me the weather" but it will also be pretty accurate at recognizing similar sentences. Now if you go into the "actions" directory, you will see a new python file that may look something like "shbfeuhrboiehbwowufeyt.py".
